# Infrastructure boilerplate

This boilerplate can be used with the setup service (see
https://setup.mergermarket.it/) to create
a minimal infrastructure type service. You must provide the following
placeholder value:

* `account_prefix` - this should be the prefix for the AWS accounts where the
                     service will be deployed (e.g. "mmg").

Note: when creating a service from this boilerplate, you should replace this
documentation with docs specific to your service
